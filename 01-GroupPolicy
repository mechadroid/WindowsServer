What is a Group Policy?

Group Policy in Windows Server is a feature used to manage and configure operating systems, applications, 
and user settings in an Active Directory environment. 

It allows administrators to implement specific configurations for users and computers across a network, 
ensuring consistent and secure management.

Group Policy has thre (3) major components
  => Group Policy Objects (GPOs):
       - These are collections of settings created using the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).
       - GPOs can be linked to Active Directory containers such as sites, domains, or organizational units (OUs).

  => Group Policy Management Console (GPMC):
       - A Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that provides a single interface for managing GPOs.
       - It simplifies the management of Group Policy across the entire organization.

  => Group Policy Client:
       - A service that runs on client computers to apply the settings defined in GPOs.
       - It ensures that the policies are enforced according to the administrator's configuration.

Types of Policies
  => Computer Configuration:
       - These policies are applied to computers, regardless of who logs on to them.
       - Includes settings for software installation, scripts, security options, and more.

  => User Configuration:
      - These policies are applied to users, regardless of which computer they log on to.
      - Includes settings for software installation, folder redirection, Internet Explorer settings, and more.

Common Uses of Group Policy
  Security Settings: 
      - Enforce password policies, account lockout policies, and other security-related settings.
  Software Deployment: 
      - Automate the installation, update, and removal of software applications.
  Startup/Shutdown Scripts: 
      - Execute scripts during the startup or shutdown of a computer.
  Logon/Logoff Scripts: 
      - Execute scripts when a user logs on or off.
  Folder Redirection: 
      - Redirect folders such as My Documents, Desktop, and others to network locations.
  Internet Explorer Maintenance: 
      - Manage Internet Explorer settings.

Advantages of Using Group Policy
  Centralized Management: 
      - Simplifies the administration of large numbers of computers and users.
  Consistency: 
      - Ensures that all users and computers have a consistent set of policies applied.
  Security: 
      - Enhances security by enforcing standardized security settings and configurations.
  Automation: 
      - Reduces the need for manual configuration and ensures that settings are applied automatically.

How Group Policy Works
  Creation of GPOs: 
      - Administrators create GPOs using the GPMC.
  Linking GPOs: 
      - GPOs are linked to Active Directory containers such as sites, domains, or OUs.
  Policy Application: 
      - The Group Policy Client service on client computers retrieves the settings from the GPOs 
        and applies them.
  Refresh Interval: 
      - By default, Group Policy is refreshed every 90 minutes on client computers and every 5 minutes 
        on domain controllers.  
      - By leveraging Group Policy, administrators can effectively manage and secure their Windows Server 
        environments, ensuring that policies are consistently applied across all users and computers in the network.
