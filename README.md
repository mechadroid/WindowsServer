# WindowsServer
My Journey to windows server

I was hired in a company that everything on its core operations depends on Microsoft,
though on my previous jobs i have work with microsoft products, im not totally into 
learning Microsoft Server (personal preferrence), and now, i do not have a choice but
to accept the fact that i have to learned microsoft server on my own, no training provided
by the company, so i have to rely on daily experience for every problem that i will be 
encountering. 

This is not a tutorial, rather it is a journal of my adventure in entering the vast
possibility and challeges this server will throw at me.

I will be glad if you will have a feedback on things that i have done in here.
